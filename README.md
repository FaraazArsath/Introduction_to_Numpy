# Introduction_to_Numpy

Numpy are the Python packages. This library provides you with an array data structure that holds some benefits over Python lists, such as being more compact, faster access in reading and writing items, being more convenient and more efficient.

To perform operations on the List elements, one needs to iterate through the List. For example, if five extra marks need to be awarded to all the entries in the student marks list.The code is lengthy and becomes computationally expensive with increase in the size of the List.

Data Science is a field that utilizes scientific methods and algorithms to generate insights from the data. These insights can then be made actionable and applied across a broad range of application domains. Data Science deals with large datatsets. Operating on such data with lists and loops is time consuming and computationally expensive.
